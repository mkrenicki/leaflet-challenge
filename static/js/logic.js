// Pick dataset from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
// Chosen data set (JSON URL): https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
// Data set is for all earthquakes with magnitude over 4.5 in past week
// Assign link to variable
var equakeJSON = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson"

// Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.


// Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color.


// Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.


// Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


// Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
